// ICE servers for the phone ↔ PC WebRTC connection: this deployment's own STUN
// and TURN (coturn on the relay host), reached with short-lived credentials the
// relay issues over this PC's authenticated relay leg (relay: lib/ice-legs.mjs).
// No third-party STUN is ever named here.
//
// `resolveRemoteIceServers()` is what the connection code calls before it builds
// a peer connection. It never throws and never waits on anything but the relay's
// answer (bounded by the control request timeout):
//   - a credential is cached until `refreshMarginMs` before it expires, so a
//     session that starts on a cached credential still has that much validity
//     left; an expired one is never handed out;
//   - when the relay cannot issue (not connected, older relay, unpaired,
//     rate-limited, timeout, malformed answer) the list degrades to the relay's
//     STUN URL alone when one is known, else empty. Credentials already held
//     and still valid keep being served while a refresh is failing;
//   - the only waiting period is the one the relay names: a rate-limited answer
//     carries `retryAfterMs`, and no request is made before it has passed.
//
// Lifetimes are counted here, on two clocks at once. performance.now() cannot
// be moved by a clock change, but how it counts time the machine spends asleep
// differs by platform, so on its own it could keep a credential past its real
// expiry; the wall clock does advance across sleep but a user or NTP can move
// it. The elapsed time is the larger of the two, so a change in either clock can
// only make a cached credential expire sooner, never later.
//
// Two clocks still cannot see a sleep that one of them skips while the other is
// then set back, so the machine's own word is used too: `invalidate()` (wired to
// the OS suspend and resume events, see RemoteRelayHandle.suspend/resume) drops
// the cached credential and the retry wait and makes any answer still on its way
// worthless. Neither the clocks nor the event is trusted alone: an answer is also
// checked against the clocks at the moment it arrives, before it is returned.
