/**
 * Who asked for a session's new tab. The visualize tool opens a URL by asking
 * the pane to create a tab and names the request; the pane's `new-tab`
 * control carries that name to the session tab strip, which reports the page
 * it made. Only the waiter with that request id gets the page, so a tab
 * nobody named (the user's "+") and an older page at the same address are
 * never mistaken for the one this request created.
 *
 * Another request's tab says nothing about this one: its tab may still be on
 * its way through a slower pane, so it never settles this waiter. A waiter
 * settles with null only when its wait times out, it is cancelled, a new watch
 * reuses its request id, or its session is released (or the host disposed).
 * The pane gives no acknowledgement when it drops or replaces a request (it
 * keeps only its latest pending address), so such a request also ends by the
 * timeout.
