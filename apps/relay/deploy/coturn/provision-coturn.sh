#!/usr/bin/env bash
# Provisions the STUN/TURN server (coturn) beside the relay. Run ON the VPS as
# root (Ubuntu 22.04+, nftables installed), from a copy of this directory:
#   bash provision-coturn.sh <relay-domain> <public-ipv4> \
#        --user-quota=<N> --issue-limit=<N>
# The two numbers are deploy-time decisions with no built-in value; deploy/README.md
# says what they mean and how to size them.
#
# Does: removes any running stock coturn and masks its unit, installs coturn,
# generates the shared secret on this host, renders the coturn config and the
# egress policy from their templates, installs the mixdog-coturn units, copies
# the relay's certificate for the TLS listener (+ a renewal hook), opens the
# firewall when ufw is active, reserves the relay port range from ephemeral
# allocation, and gives the relay unit a drop-in that reads the secret.
#
# Idempotent: a second run keeps the existing secret. To rotate it, run
# deprovision-coturn.sh first, then this, then restart mixdog-relay.
# It never restarts the relay: run it before a relay deploy (which restarts the
# relay once) or restart mixdog-relay yourself afterwards.
