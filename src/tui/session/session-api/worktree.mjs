/**
 * worktree.mjs — the session object's Lead worktree surface. The daemon
 * resolves these advertised actions by name (session-protocol.mjs) and each
 * delegates to the runtime's workspace transition authority
 * (session-runtime/workspace/transitions.mjs), then republishes the route
 * state so the new `workspace` reaches every viewer. Failures are typed
 * WorktreeErrors whose `code` crosses the daemon wire; a runtime without the
 * authority rejects with WORKTREE_NOT_IMPLEMENTED.
 *
 *   getBranchMenu()                                → { workspace, pendingWorktree, branches, occupancy, retainedWorktree }
 *   getProjectBranchMenu({ projectPath })          → { workspace, branches, occupancy, retainedWorktree: null }
 *     (no session: a New Task draft or the source-control dock)
 *   selectBranch({ branch, create?, expectedRevision?, confirmLarge? }) → { revision, workspace }
 *   selectProjectBranch({ projectPath, branch, create?, remote?, startPoint? }) → { branch, changed, commit? }
 *   selectProjectBranch({ projectPath, detach: commitId }) → { branch: null, changed, commit, detached: true }
 *     (no session: the guarded project-folder checkout)
 *   mergeProjectBranch({ projectPath, branch, target }) → backend merge result
 *     (no session: the source-control dock's merge into the confirmed target)
 *   requestWorktree({ name?, confirmLarge?, provision?, prompt?, txId?, expectedRevision? }) → { revision, workspace, pending, warnings? }
 *     (provision: a New Task's first send creates and enters it now)
 *   mergeWorkspace({ confirmed: true, target, cleanup?, expectedRevision? }) → backend merge result (+ cleanup)
 *   removeWorktree({ force?, expectedRevision? })  → { revision, workspace, removed }
 *     (expectedRevision: WORKTREE_REVISION_CONFLICT when the session moved on)
 *     (WORKTREE_REMOVAL_INCOMPLETE: partly removed; call again to finish)
 *   listWorktrees()                                → every managed worktree with its retention
 *   pruneWorktrees()                               → reconcile report (with autoCleanup on, also the
 *     count/age limits and archive rules of the automatic cleanup)
 *   previewWorktreeCleanup({ repoCommonDir? })     → { hasCandidates } (whether pruneWorktrees could act on
 *     anything; read-only, no git verification)
 *   deleteWorktree({ entryId, force? })          → { removed, entryId, path } (Settings → Worktrees;
 *     refuses one in use, dirty or unmerged work unless `force`)
 *   getSessionWorktreeWork({ sessionIds })          → { sessionIds } owning a worktree removal would refuse
 *   setArchivedSessionWorktrees({ sessionIds, archived }) → { changed } (autoCleanup on: archived
 *     sessions' worktrees become disposable for the startup reconcile / prune; a restore unmarks) */
