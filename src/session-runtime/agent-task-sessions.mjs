/**
 * `session create`: an attended agent-mode conversation (an agent's home
 * thread) hands coding to a new, visible coding-mode task session — the
 * user's own Lead, created through the same session service and defaults as a
 * desktop New task — and gets each of its own turns' results back.
 *
 * Only turns the origin agent starts (the brief, a later `send` from it)
 * report: when such a turn ends its result is queued durably for the agent's
 * home (agent-home-delivery.mjs), which posts it and wakes the agent once to
 * relay it. The session's other answers in that chain (given while work it
 * handed to its agents still runs) are queued as progress updates that wake
 * nobody: the agent reads them before its next turn, whatever starts it
 * (agent-home-delivery.mjs postBeforeTurn), and the final report never
 * repeats one that already carried its answer. A turn blocked on the user's
 * answer or approval posts one faint line instead; the card stays in the task
 * session for the user.
 *
 * Whether a turn reports is apart from whose work it is: every accepted send
 * of an agent is the agent's work in that session (bot-owned-work.mjs, shown
 * as the bot working) until its chain ends, the point a report would be
 * final, and with `notify: false` or an unstored watch it reports nothing.
 * A turn the user types there is owned by no agent.
 *
 * An agent's send to any other session reports the same way, by an origin for
 * that send only (reportOrigin). Every reporting turn is also watched durably
 * (agent-home-delivery.mjs `watches`) until its end is queued, so a daemon
 * restart before that re-attaches it (recover): an ended turn reports once
 * from the target's record, a queued or running one is watched to its end.
 *
 * A group-room member (its member session `sess_rmem_<room>_<agent>`) opens
 * and drives task sessions the same way; its reports carry `from` (the member
 * session), so they land in that member session alone, never in its home or
 * the room's log, and an ended turn gives the member a turn in its room to
 * relay it (agent-home-delivery.mjs enqueueTask).
 *
 * A send to a group room's log goes to one member through the desktop room
 * host (daemon-session-control.mjs): the member's turn in its member session
 * is the reporting turn, taken by the room (`submit`), not by a prompt.
