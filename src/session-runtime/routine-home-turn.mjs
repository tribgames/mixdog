/**
 * A routine fire (schedule or webhook) is a TURN in its owner bot's home
 * thread (`sess_home_<agentId>`): the routine's instructions are delivered
 * there as a queued turn the bot handles itself — doing it or delegating as
 * in any turn — and its reply in the chat is the result. Nothing else is
 * created: no run session, no result card.
 *
 * The turn waits behind the thread's own work (a user turn, another routine):
 * it rides the thread's queue as its own `routine` entry (one per turn, never
 * merged or steered into another), shows as a routine marker row, and selects
 * skills only from the routine's instructions (`skillSelection`), never from a
 * webhook payload. While it runs the thread counts as an unattended run
 * (held-requests.mjs): the saved routine is the user's grant, so it never asks
 * (outbound actions are allowed within the bot's permissions; payments and
 * permanent deletes are refused, human-gate/run-policy.mjs). Resolves with the
 * reply once the turn ends; rejects when the turn fails, is cancelled, or the
 * caller's `signal` aborts (which also aborts the turn once it runs). With an
 * `executorAgentId` the fire is first carried out by that sub-agent
 * (routine-executor.mjs) and the turn holds only its final report, which the
 * bot relays; the quiet marker as the report wakes nobody and resolves it. A
 * heartbeat turn past its wall-clock cap is aborted and resolves with no reply
 * (`timedOut`).
