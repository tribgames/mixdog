/**
 * Mixy's heartbeat: at the user's chosen interval (heartbeatIntervalMinutes,
 * 30 min / 1 h / 2 h / 4 h, default 1 h, read live at each tick), one check of
 * what happened since the last one, in three stages that each stop as early as they can.
 *  1. Collect (no model): a bounded digest of what happened in the interval:
 *     sessions the user talks in with new activity (Lead sessions, bot chats,
 *     group rooms; never Mixy's own chat, the heartbeat's hidden sessions,
 *     exec or memory runs, room seats or a Lead's delegated agents), agent
 *     task sessions that finished, approvals
 *     waiting (only when more wait than at the last handled check) and
 *     routines that keep failing. Sessions and tasks past the digest's bounds
 *     are counted in one line; nothing carries over to the next check. A
 *     failing routine is reported once, then at most every 6 hours while it
 *     still fails (once when it switched itself off); a success closes it.
 *  2. Gate: a digest equal to the last check's, or an empty one, ends the
 *     check. Otherwise the Maintainer model reviews each session and task
 *     line in its own call over the latest 12 of that session's messages
 *     since its last review (tool calls left out), given that review's note
 *     (a few at a time; the cursor then moves to the newest item and the line
 *     says how many older messages went unreviewed, or that its cursor was
 *     not found; a session with no new item keeps its note without a call; a
 *     line it finds nothing in is dropped unless it says that, its note is
 *     appended, a failed read or review keeps the line as collected), then answers once on the reviewed
 *     digest with Mixy's last delivered message of the past day
 *     (heartbeat-completion.mjs). Without one
 *     (it is off by default), after a
 *     failed call, or once its circuit breaker tripped (3 unusable replies or
 *     5 provider failures in a row of the gate call, until a restart or a
 *     Maintainer model change), only a routine failing 3+ times in a row or
 *     newly switched off wakes Mixy.
 *  3. Wake: one unattended routine turn (routine-home-turn.mjs) in a new
 *     hidden session of Mixy (an exec run, kept out of every session list),
 *     given the gate's items, the reviewed lines with their session ids and
 *     her last delivered message.
 *     Its reply HEARTBEAT_QUIET means nothing to say and nothing is shown;
 *     any other reply is posted once into her home chat as her own message
 *     (agent-home-delivery.mjs), with no turn or routine marker there. The
 *     turn hands no work off (workspace-tools.mjs refuses it), and the
 *     finished session is closed for the store's tombstone sweep; a close
 *     that did not land is retried on each tick.
 * The collection watermark, the digest hash and the routines' report state
 * advance only once a check is handled (a nothing decision, nothing to wake
 * for, or a wake whose reply was delivered); a failed collection (any
 * source), Maintainer call or wake leaves them for the next check, and a
 * routine-only wake after a failed Maintainer call commits just its routine
 * warnings. A due check waits while the user is active: the user is idle only
 * after 30 minutes with no operation, an operation being a turn they sent or
 * an input (keyboard, mouse buttons, wheel, mouse movement) in the desktop
 * app's own windows, which the app reports (noteUserInput), as this process
 * saw it or the state file kept it. Input elsewhere on the machine, and
 * routine and other runtime-made turns, are no user activity; without the
 * desktop app only sent turns count. Missed checks run as one; two never run
 * at once; the first one after a start is looked at after a minute. The setting `heartbeat: false` (setup
 * set_heartbeat_enabled) stops it, and so does a representative bot that does
 * not exist (mixy-presence.mjs, as the desktop shows her): no check runs
 * and the watermark is cleared, so the first check once Mixy exists arms anew.
 *
 * Proposals Mixy makes (session action suggest) live in the same state file
 * under a stable key (action:target): the same key is refreshed, a declined
 * key is never offered again (declines are kept for good), at most 5 wait
 * and each expires after 72 hours.
