// Whether the daemon-owner.json record still names a daemon, and the lease a
// daemon holds on it.
//
// A live pid proves nothing on its own. A daemon terminated without running
// its exit hooks (Windows shutdown, an installer or Task Manager ending the
// process tree) leaves its owner record behind, and the OS soon hands that pid
// to an unrelated process. A pid-only check then reported a live owner for as
// long as that process ran: every launcher waited for it to publish, every
// spawned candidate yielded to it, and the desktop failed every call with
// "daemon session endpoint is unavailable".
//
// Single-owner safety never rests on the wall clock:
// - Holder: keeps its lease in monotonic time since its last successful
//   refresh. An expired lease fences it (refuse work, shut down) instead of
//   being renewed, and every register/call asks `admit()` first. After an
//   event-loop stall nothing is served until a refresh under the claim lock
//   proves the record still names it — a contender's claim takes that lock.
//   A lease that ran out while that re-verification was pending — DURING
//   the stall (live when the loop stopped), or after stalls the starved loop
//   ended before it but too late to complete the refresh — is the one
//   exception to the fence: nothing was admitted since the stall, and a
//   contender's reclaim is decided under the claim lock against the record's
//   heartbeat there (daemonOwnerIsStale re-checks it), so a refresh started
//   after the stall that finds the record still naming this pid proves no
//   contender took it and none can on its earlier proof. Without that, a sole
//   daemon whose loop the machine starved past the lease killed itself and
//   every running turn with no other daemon to take over.
// - Holder's record names `livenessPort` from its very first claim: a tiny
//   loopback listener started BEFORE the claim (startOwnerLivenessListener)
//   answers /health with the pid, through boot and for the process lifetime.
// - Contender: may reclaim a live-pid record only when its heartbeat looks
//   stale (wall clock: a reused pid never beats) AND that port, probed for the
//   full OWNER_PROBE_TIMEOUT_MS, does not answer with that pid — never on
//   wall-clock staleness alone, so a clock jump never reclaims a holder that
//   answers, booting or not; a holder silent for that long has stalled past
//   `stallMs` and re-verifies before serving again.
//
// Records without a heartbeat come from v1.1.2 and older (and records with a
// heartbeat but no liveness port only from unreleased intermediate builds,
// judged the same way). Their pid matching the leftover daemon.json proves
// nothing — a crashed daemon leaves both files behind — so only the endpoint
// daemon.json publishes, answering with that pid, proves them alive.
