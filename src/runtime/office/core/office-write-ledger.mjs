/**
 * office-write-ledger.mjs — the workspace files one Office Use call wrote,

 * them as its own changes and Undo can restore them.
 *
 * Ownership is never inferred from the folder: every route that writes a
 * workspace file — the session's working copy, a created or converted
 * document, a render's preview and page images, a split/extract/query output,
 * an authored document and its sidecars, a secured PDF — hands the path to
 * noteOfficeWrite BEFORE it writes, which captures the file's prior state.
 * After the call, only noted files whose bytes changed are recorded. Scratch
 * files outside the workspace (the system temp folder, the Office data
 * folder) are never noted.
