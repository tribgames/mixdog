// Post-exit descendant observation for the shell runner.
//
// The question this module answers is "did the command leave anything
// RUNNING?", and it answers it by looking at PROCESSES — never at the command
// text. Nothing here parses, classifies or rewrites a single byte of what the
// caller typed; the shell receives the command exactly as written and the
// decision is taken afterwards from what the operating system reports.
//
// Evidence per platform, both produced by the existing spawn infrastructure:
//   POSIX  — native/mixdog-spawn spawns every shell with `process_group(0)`,
//            so the command owns a process group whose id is the shell pid.
//            Once the shell has exited and been reaped, ANY remaining member
//            of that group is a descendant it left behind, and one signal to
//            the negative pgid reaches all of them.
//   win32  — inspect the process table after every root exit. Closed pipes
//            cannot prove termination: descendants may redirect their stdio.
//            The strict snapshot names survivors still linked to the root.
//
// Every process is tracked by IDENTITY — pid plus creation token from the
// same table read — never by pid alone: a recycled pid is a different process
// and neither keeps a tracked survivor "alive" nor becomes a kill target.
