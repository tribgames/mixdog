/**
 * gemini-reasoning-relay.mjs — the thought-summary relay of one Gemini send.
 *
 * Thought text streams to the caller's `onReasoningDelta`. A stream that is
 * re-issued (retry, empty-answer re-ask, non-streaming recovery) would show
 * its thinking twice, so before each new attempt the thinking already shown
 * is retracted through `onTextReset` — reasoning only, no answer text, which
 * the loop's own replay retraction also accepts without an owner ack.
