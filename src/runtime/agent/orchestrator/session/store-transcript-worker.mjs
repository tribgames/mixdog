/**
 * Off-thread read + parse + projection of a stored transcript.
 *
 * A cold pane read used to cost the daemon event loop the whole pipeline: a
 * chunked async read whose every 512 KB chunk waited for a loop turn, a
 * SHA-256 of the text, the strict record parse and a projection that meters
 * every message of the transcript (`slow stored projection`). Under a busy
 * loop each read stretched to seconds. This worker runs exactly that pipeline
 * (stat → read → stat, digest, readTopLevelLifecycleRecord →
 * projectStoredTranscript with no turn checkpoint) and hands back the
 * digest and one slice of the session's display history: the history itself
 * is built once per content and kept here with its base, and only the window
 * or page a request names (`slice`: `{ limit, skip }`) crosses back, with its
 * serialized size measured here.
 *
 * Inside the worker, one projection base (recovery, prepared session and
 * whole-transcript context gauge) per session content is shared by every
 * window and every concurrent request of it, and a new version of a session
 * reuses the parsed messages its previous version already metered wherever
 * they are unchanged, so an appended turn re-meters only the new tail.
 * Bodies read but not yet built are bounded (`createBaseBuilds`): room is
 * reserved before a record is read, and a newer version of a session
 * replaces its queued older build.
 *
 * Client (main thread): `projectStoredTranscriptOffThread`. Worker side is
 * active only when this file is loaded as a worker of that client.
