/**
 * usage-ledger-rollup.mjs — how the ledger answers one rollup query, in the
 * order the answer has to be assembled:
 *   - the query window (calendar days, or a rolling ms range),
 *   - the per-bucket measurement algebra (empty bucket + row accumulation),
 *   - the hourly event rows of one day,
 *   - the daily amounts (cached whole days, or rebuilt from retained events
 *     when the window is partial) folded into day / route / conversation
 *     buckets,
 *   - session attribution, which day_sessions cannot express per route,
 *   - the legacy whole-day documents merged for disjoint historical routes.
 *
 * Every step reads the ledger database and writes into the day map; nothing
 * here mutates stored rows. Storage, schema and inserts stay in
 * usage-ledger.mjs.
