# Native Word authoring

The model owns the editing design. The tool implements it and reports structural
and rendering evidence; it must not choose a visual style merely because the
file is a Word document.

## Native route essentials

- **Define the styles first**: `define_styles` sets `Title`, `Heading 1`, `Heading 2`, `Normal`, and `Caption` once (face, size, weight, colour, spacing, keeps), and every `append_text style:'Heading 1'` takes them with no properties of its own — a paragraph the reader adds in Word under that style then matches, which per-paragraph properties never give. `properties` stay for the one-off (a cover eyebrow, a callout's field). Batch all known operations.
- `lineSpacing` is a minimum in points, not a multiplier. Native `properties.nameEastAsia` chooses the recipient's Korean font independently of the Latin `name`; set both when required for predictable rendering.
- A carrier the content needs (cover group, callout, quote, stat strip, caption, table anatomy, the Korean type ladder) is drawn from "Document anatomy" below, so it reads the same on every page of this document and on both backends.
- A table's figure columns are right-aligned through `properties.columnAlignments:['left','right',…]` (`alignment` places the whole table, so a list there is refused); the header row is bold and ruled and body rows take hairlines on both backends unless `style`, `borders`, or `shading` says otherwise (`headerBold:false` opts out) — that is the native default, not the concept's table: open, zebra, ruled-grid, or no-header tables are set through `borders`/`shading` (or CSS on the HTML route). A total row is `properties.totalRow:true` (bold over a rule); a row of its own type is `properties.rowStyles` (a stat strip's 22 pt figures over 9 pt labels in one table). → runtime `total_row_unmarked`, `table_label_oversized`
- `add_note find:<phrase> text:<source>` puts a number's source at the foot of the page where the reader meets it (`kind:'endnote'` sends it to the end instead); the result says whether the mark landed on the phrase or its paragraph, and the snapshot counts only real notes.
- Hidden text: `properties:{ hidden: true }` on `append_text` or `set_font` makes a working note travel with the document without printing, and the audit does not measure ink no reader sees.

The runtime absorbs what it can (edge spaces are preserved, list numbering is defined, package validity is checked at finalize). What it cannot, the author must avoid:

| Boundary | Failure → runtime code |
|---|---|
| A list marker comes from `listKind:'bullet'|'number'` (append_text properties) or `set_list`, never a typed `•` or `- ` | a double or fake bullet → `literal_bullet` |
| One paragraph per `append_text`; never `\n` inside `text` | the newline renders as a space → `newline_in_text` |
| A TOC (`insert_toc`) lists paragraphs styled `Heading 1..3`; a bold Normal paragraph is not a heading. Insert it after the headings exist (`paragraph:<n>` places it under the title): the field caches the outline it finds, and a TOC inserted into an empty document renders as its update prompt until Word rebuilds it | an empty TOC → `heading_hierarchy_missing` |
| Page numbers are fields (`add_page_numbers`, `separator:' / '` for "3 / 12"), never typed digits; a cover without the running line takes `set_header_footer variant:'first' text:''` | wrong numbers after any edit; a header above the cover's eyebrow |
| Deleted text lives in `<w:delText>` inside `<w:del>`, inserted text in `<w:t>` inside `<w:ins>` (hand-built XML only; the operations do this) | Word refuses the file → `text_in_deletion`, `deleted_text_in_insertion` |
| A text element with an edge space carries `xml:space="preserve"` | "HelloWorld" → `whitespace_not_preserved` |
| Comment range markers come in pairs and match a comment | → `comment_marker_mismatch` |
| A picture carries about 150 pixels per inch at the size it is placed | an enlarged thumbnail prints soft → `image_low_resolution` |
| A table that crosses a page repeats its header row (`add_table` `properties.repeatHeader`, on by default) | unlabelled columns after the break → `table_header_not_repeated` |

## Control map

- Document face: `set_document_font properties:{ name, nameEastAsia, size, color }`
  sets the body's face, size and ink as the document's own, so a paragraph
  added later — by `append_text` or by hand in Word — matches the body; a
  Korean document names an installed face covering Hangul and digits
  (for example Noto Sans KR, Malgun Gothic, or a Korean serif) so they
  share one.
- Page: `set_page properties:{ pageSize, orientation, topMargin, bottomMargin,
  leftMargin, rightMargin, columns, columnSpacing }`. A new document is A4;
  a US reader gets `pageSize:'letter'` (also `'legal'`, `'a3'`, `'a5'`,
  `'tabloid'`, or `[width, height]` in points), and `orientation` turns the
  sheet. Margins and `columnSpacing` are points;
  the margins together determine the body width. `columns:<n>` lays the section
  out in that many even columns and the prose flows through them — a newsletter
  or brochure page is a section property, never a row of text boxes — and
  `columns:1` returns the section to a single column.
  Without `section` the edit lands on the section being written into (the last);
  `section:<n>` revisits an earlier one.
- Notes: `add_note` ("Native route essentials") also takes `paragraph:<n>` instead of
  `find`; its mark is a superscript reference.
- Sections: `insert_break kind:'section_next'` closes the current section and
  starts the next one on a new page (`'section_continuous'` on the same page),
  so a wide table can take `set_page properties:{ orientation:'landscape' }`
  while the prose before and after stays portrait. Break before the heading that
  introduces the table, so the heading, its lead-in, and the table share the
  landscape page: broken after the lead-in, the portrait page held a heading and one
  paragraph above an empty page, and the table stood on the next page without its
  heading. Running headers and page numbers carry across the break; `kind:'page'`
  is an ordinary page break.
- Paragraph: `append_text text style properties`. Use `Title`, `Heading 1`,
  `Heading 2` or `Normal` for the actual role. Each call creates one paragraph.
- Lists: `properties:{ listKind:'bullet'|'number', listLevel }`. A numbered list
  starts again at 1 after a heading, a body paragraph, a callout, or a table; the
  step that carries a procedure on past a note between its steps takes
  `listContinue:true`, or it reads 1 again. Its levels count the global
  1. a. i., and a list that opens on Korean text counts 1. 가. 1), the Korean
  document convention; `listNumbering:'global'|'korean'` names it for the list an
  item opens, and an item that continues a list keeps the list's own.
- Type: `properties:{ name, nameEastAsia, size, bold, italic, color }`. Hangul, kana, and Han have no italic (Word
  and LibreOffice slant them synthetically): a Korean pull quote or caption is set apart by colour, weight, a rule, or
  an indent instead.
  Latin and East Asian faces are independent. Set intentional values rather
  than inheriting an unknown template's display formatting.
- Flow: `properties:{ alignment, spacingBefore, spacingAfter, lineSpacing,
  keepWithNext, keepTogether, widowControl, pageBreakBefore }`.
  Spacing is in points. Keep headings with their next content, not every body
  paragraph with the next paragraph. Let body paragraphs flow before adding
  intentional breaks based on the render. A clause that carries its own mark in
  the text ("①", "가.") hangs it: `text:'①\t…'` with `indentLeft:18,
  indentFirstLine:-18`, so a wrapped line starts under the words, not under the mark.
- Tab stops: a contents line, a signature line, or a label with its figure at
  the right margin is one paragraph with `\t` in `text` and
  `properties:{ tabStops:[{ position:<pt from the left margin>, alignment:'right',
  leader:'dot' }] }` — never dots or spaces typed to fill the gap, which break
  at any font or width change. The snapshot reads the tab back as `\t`.
- Tables and figures: use native `add_table`, cell/column formatting and
  `add_image altText:<what the picture shows>` — without the description the
  audit reports `missing_alt_text` and a reader who cannot see it gets nothing.
  Define column widths from the usable body width, not the page
  width. A table should not stand in for ordinary prose.
  A table's own text is set on the operation: `properties:{ fontName,
  fontNameEastAsia, fontSize, color, textStyle, spacingAfter }` reach every
  cell. Set `fontNameEastAsia` for a Korean table — cells left on the document
  default fall back per cell, and a Korean label lands on a different baseline
  from the figure beside it. Emphasis inside one cell stays with
  `set_table_cell_style`. The first row is the header and repeats on every
  continuation page; `repeatHeader:false` says the row is data, and
  `headerRows:<n>` makes a header of several rows (see "Table anatomy").
  `alignment` places the whole table on the page (`left`, `center`, `right`);
  column alignment and the default anatomy are in "Native route essentials" and "Table
  anatomy" below. Bullets, Korean word wrapping, and that anatomy read the same
  in Word and in the portable file.
- Footer: `add_page_numbers` supplies fields. `prefix:''`, `separator:' / '`
  is one available numbering treatment, not a required style.

Use `describe format:'docx' operation:<op>` for a missing operation field.
There is no required design-plan JSON or preliminary specimen; decide enough
to author the requested document, then inspect the real pages.

## Document anatomy (recipes in native operations)

The carriers a report needs beyond running prose, each as the operations that draw it the same in Word
and in the portable file. Distances are points; `properties` go on `append_text` (or `set_paragraph_format`
for an existing paragraph). Use a carrier when the content has that job, never as decoration (`SKILL.md` §4).
Colours are the author's palette roles — `<ink>`, `<muted>`, `<line>`, `<tint>`, `<accent>` — as six-digit hex.
The optional concept examples are not required. The carriers below are the native route's (editing a
document, a template, a small generated one); a new designed document draws the same jobs in HTML, with the concept's
own forms (`references/html.md` §3). Where this list gives one form (a left-bar callout, a ruled table), it is one
option: a boxed note, a tinted band, or no callout, and open or zebra tables, are equally native (`border`, `shading`, `borders`).

- **Type ladder for a Korean report** (body 10.5 pt): `Title` 24-26 bold · `Heading 1` 15-16 bold,
  `spacingBefore:18, spacingAfter:6, keepWithNext:true` · `Heading 2` 12.5-13 bold, `spacingBefore:12,
  spacingAfter:4, keepWithNext:true` · body `size:10.5, lineSpacing:18, spacingAfter:8, alignment:'left'`
  (lineSpacing is a minimum in points: 1.7× for Hangul, never 1.15× — Korean lines set at Latin leading
  touch; the alignment is explicit because a Korean Word's Normal style justifies, and justified Hangul
  opens gaps between words that the portable file, set left, never shows) · caption
  9 pt `<muted>`. This is the one document scale, shared with flowing PDF. One Latin face and one East Asian face
  for the whole document (`name` + `nameEastAsia` on a paragraph, `fontName` + `fontNameEastAsia` on `add_table` — the
  table names its own type and refuses the paragraph's field names), chosen from the concept's face menu: an essay or
  letter takes a serif pairing (Cambria + 바탕/Noto Serif KR), a brief sets both faces in a Korean sans (`name` and
  `nameEastAsia` both Noto Sans KR, or both Malgun Gothic), an editorial piece mixes serif headings with a sans body:
  beside Calibri figures the Hangul prints larger and heavier, and "184,200건" reads as two sizes. The ladder is
  written once, as the document's styles, before the first
  paragraph: `{ op:'define_styles', styles:{ Title:{ name, nameEastAsia, size:24, bold:true, color:<ink>,
  alignment:'left', lineSpacing:30, lineSpacingRule:'exact', spacingAfter:8 }, 'Heading 1':{ …, size:15, bold:true,
  spacingBefore:18, spacingAfter:6, keepWithNext:true }, 'Heading 2':{ … }, Normal:{ name, nameEastAsia, size:10.5,
  lineSpacing:18, spacingAfter:8, alignment:'left' }, Caption:{ size:9, color:<muted>, spacingBefore:4,
  spacingAfter:14 } } }`; then `append_text style:'Heading 1' text:'2. 근거'` carries nothing else, and a
  caption is `style:'Caption'`.
- **Cover group**: eyebrow (`size:9.5, bold:true, color:<accent>, spacingAfter:4`) → `Title` with
  `alignment:'left'` (Word's own Title style centers it and the portable file does not; say which) and
  `lineSpacing:<1.25 × its size>, lineSpacingRule:'exact'` (30 for 24 pt) — a minimum can only widen a line, and on
  Malgun Gothic's own line the two lines of one wrapped title stood nearly twice the size apart → subtitle
  (`size:13, color:<ink> or <muted>, spacingAfter:8`) → meta lines (`size:9.5, color:<muted>`) → a rule: an empty
  paragraph with `border:{ side:'bottom', size:8, color:<accent> }, spacingAfter:24`. The summary follows on
  the same page; `insert_break kind:'page'` only when the document is long enough to earn a cover page.
- **Table of contents**: `insert_toc paragraph:<after the cover>` once every `Heading 1..3` exists
  (the TOC boundary above); `paragraph` is the one the contents follow (the "목차" label's number). A portable
  render writes each entry's page behind a dot leader, so render before reading the contents page; a document
  under six headings does not need one. Its own title ("목차") is a
  bold paragraph with the section-header look (`size:15, bold:true, keepWithNext:true`), never a `Heading`
  style — a heading lists itself as the first entry.
- **Section header**: `Heading 1` with `keepWithNext:true`; a numbered section carries its number in the text
  ("2. 근거"), never a typed tab or a list marker.
- **Callout** (the conclusion, a warning, the ask) — optional, and its form is the concept's: a tinted band
  (`shading:<tint>` with indents, no border), a boxed note (`border` on all four sides in `<line>` or `<accent>`), a
  left rule (below), or none — the conclusion as a larger first paragraph. The left-rule form: one paragraph with
  `shading:<tint>, border:{ side:'left',
  size:12, color:<accent> }, indentLeft:12, indentRight:12, spacingBefore:6, spacingAfter:12`; a label
  paragraph above it in the same field (`bold:true, size:8.5, color:<accent>, spacingAfter:2, shading, indentLeft`)
  when the field needs a name. Every paragraph of one callout carries the same `shading` and indents so the
  field reads as one. Points inside it (a warning's items) are list items with those same properties plus
  `listKind`: on a list item `indentLeft` places the mark and the text hangs 18 pt after it, inside the field.
- **Quote**: `indentLeft:16, border:{ side:'left', size:16, color:<accent> }, size:12.5, lineSpacing:20,
  color:<ink>, spacingBefore:10, keepTogether:true, keepWithNext:true`; the attribution a caption under it
  (`size:9, color:<muted>, indentLeft:16, spacingAfter:12`) beginning "— ". The two keeps hold the quote whole and on
  the page of its attribution — without them a two-line quote ending a page left one line behind and carried the other
  over with its speaker. The space above sets it apart from what it follows: without it a quote under a list sat as
  close to the last item as the items to each other and read as one more of them.
- **Stat strip** (two to four figures with one cause): `add_table` with one row of values and one row of labels,
  `properties:{ borders:{ top:{ enabled:false }, left:{ enabled:false }, right:{ enabled:false }, insideV:{ enabled:false },
  insideH:{ enabled:false }, bottom:{ style:'single', size:4, color:<line> } }, repeatHeader:false,
  columnAlignments:['left', …], rowStyles:[{ fontSize:22, color:<accent>, bold:true }, { fontSize:9, color:<muted> }] }`
  — one table, the figures at display size over their labels at caption size. A single `fontSize` sets the labels at
  22 pt too ("평균 대기 시간 단축" over three lines). → runtime `table_label_oversized`
- **Chart**: `add_chart categories:[…] values:[…] chartType:'bar'|'column' unit highlight forecast accent` — one series
  drawn as a picture in the document's accent (`accent:<accent hex>`, the concept's accent that the document's headings and emphasis use;
  without it the writer's teal), every bar carrying its value and no grid; `bar` for a ranking (names on the
  left), `column` for periods, `highlight` the bar the paragraph is about, `forecast` the bars that are projections
  (a plan, an estimate: drawn pale in a dashed outline, never as counted figures). It lands like `add_image` (`width`,
  `properties:{ alignment:'center' }`) with a caption under it; its altText names each figure. The bars cannot be
  edited in Word — a chart the reader will edit belongs in a workbook.
- **Caption**: the paragraph under a table or picture, `size:9, color:<muted>, spacingBefore:4,
  spacingAfter:14`: what it shows and its source. The table above it takes `properties.keepWithNext:true`
  so the caption never starts the next page alone, and the paragraph that introduces a table or chart takes
  `keepWithNext:true` too — without it a heading and its lead-in closed one page and the table opened the next; a picture (`add_image`) keeps with its caption on its own,
  and `properties:{ alignment:'center' }` centres it.
- **Running header**: `set_header_footer kind:'header'` with `properties:{ name, nameEastAsia, size:8.5,
  color:<muted> }` — a running head and folio are a choice of the concept (a letter or essay takes none) — without them the line prints in the document default, louder than the eyebrow under it.
  The cover page carries neither: after the default header and the page numbers (`add_page_numbers separator:' / '`
  prints "1 / 3"), `set_header_footer kind:'header' variant:'first' text:''` and the same for the footer give the
  first page empty ones.
- **Total row**: `add_table properties.totalRow:true` sets the last row bold over a rule; a total set like the rows
  it sums reads as one more of them. → runtime `total_row_unmarked`
- **Two columns**: not a paragraph property; long prose that wants two columns is a section of its own
  with `set_page properties:{ columns:2 }` (Control map), opened by `insert_break kind:'section_continuous'` under
  the masthead or picture and closed by another one (then `columns:1`) so the two columns balance on the page — use a table with two borderless cells only for a
  short side-by-side (a before/after, a term and its definition), never for running text.
- **Table anatomy**: the default (a bold header on a rule, hairlines between rows, figures right through
  `columnAlignments`, body cells on their top edge so a row reads from its first line and the header on its
  bottom edge over the rule, one exact line pitch per cell so a Latin-only figure and a Hangul one share the
  row's baseline) is the anatomy; `shading` on the header only when the document's fields use the same tint. A
  figure column names its unit in the header ("처리량 (건)"), not in every cell. `set_table_cell_style`
  patches one cell (`fillColor`, `fontSize`, `bold`, `color`, `verticalAlignment`) and keeps the rest.
  `insert_table_row` copies the row it goes before, so a data row inserted above a total takes the total's shading
  and weight: give its cells the data rows' look back (`fillColor:null` takes the shading away, `bold:false` on the
  figures). A two-level
  header — a group label over the columns it spans ("3분기 처리량" over 7월 · 8월 · 9월) — is `properties.headerRows:2`
  with the group merged across its columns and the single labels down both rows (`merge_table_cells`, right to
  left): every header row is set bold on its bottom edge and repeats on a continuation page. Left at one header
  row, the months under the group are set as data, plain and on their top edge.

## Optional preset

`compose_document` remains a convenience for a brief whose built-in structure
actually suits the task. It picks type sizes, summary emphasis and spacing;
do not select it for a design-led task and then fight those choices.

It takes `title`, optional `subtitle`, `summary`, `metrics` (`{ value, label,
detail? }`; the accent goes to the figure marked `emphasis: true`, else to the
first), `sections`, `footer` and `pageNumbers`. Sections may contain headings, paragraphs, bullets,
tables, quotes, callouts and roadmaps. A section table is `table:[[…],[…]]`
(first row as the header) or `table:{ headers:[…], rows:[[…]] }`; any other
shape is refused rather than dropped. `purpose` and `variant` select its family.
Use `describe ... operation:'compose_document'` before relying on unlisted
controls. Calling the composer or explicitly selecting `design.profile` opts
into preset design; otherwise use native operations.

## Local refinement

`set_paragraph_format` changes only supplied fields. `set_font find` styles
only the first matching phrase in the body, across text fragments; it does not
change matching footer text. Use those operations for local corrections.
If the design direction is wrong, revisit the hierarchy or body width rather
than shrinking the text until a page counter turns green.
